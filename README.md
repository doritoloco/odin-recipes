Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes will consist of a main index page that will have a list of dish names and when clicked, it will direct to a page that has a recipe and a finished product of what that dish should look like.

The Technologies that I will be using is pure html for this project.
Odin Recipes for now will only consist of the basic html for mainly links and images
